# Bikeshare project: Capital Bikeshare
## Introduction
The aim of this project is to do analysis on the data by Capital Bikeshare, a company operating a bike share in Washington DC, using several different machine learning methods.
The following questions are in the focus:
a) How can we make sure that registered users always find a bike to ride when they need it?
b) What about casual users? Do their habits differ significantly from the registered ones?
c) How does weather affect the number of rides?
d) What about air pollution and rush hour traffic?
